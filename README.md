# Node.js server for a real-time multiplayer 2D space shooter

### Small Node.js dedicated server for a multiplayer space shooter.
It works best on the local network since it's not optimized for larger latency networks.
I worked on this project primarily for personal educational purposes, so don't think of this as a "production-ready multiplayer game".

Take a look at the code, tweak it and play around it. ðŸ˜„

### Usage:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Download the project
3. Using a terminal navigate to project directory
4. Run `npm install` command to install all project dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start the server
6. In the browser, navigate to **http://localhost:3000**. In the other tab, do the same thing to have two different players connecting to the game
7. (optional) To change the port that server is listening on, open the `./app.js` file and change the value of the `PORT` constant
8. Enjoy!
