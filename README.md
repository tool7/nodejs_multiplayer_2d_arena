# Node.js server for a real-time multiplayer 2D space shooter

### Small Node.js dedicated server for a multiplayer space shooter.
It works best on a local network since it's not optimized for larger latency networks.
I worked on this project primarily for personal educational purposes, so please don't think of this as a "production-ready multiplayer game". Take a look at the code, tweak it and play around it. :D

### Usage:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Download the project
3. Using a terminal navigate to project directory
4. Run **npm install** command to install all project dependencies
5. Run **npm start** to start the server
6. In the browser, navigate to ***localhost:3000***. In the other tab, do the same thing to have two different players connecting to the game
7. (optional) To change the port a server is listening on, open the **./app.js** file and change the value of the *PORT* constant
8. Enjoy  :D
